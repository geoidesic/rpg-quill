# RPG Quill
An interactive and dynamic character sheet for Dungeons and Dragons fifth edition role-playing game (D&D 5E). 

Currently data is stored in your browser – so if you clear the cache you will lose your character settings. 

This code base is currently just source, not build. It is built on the Quasar Framework for VueJS, which allows one to build to various platforms.

# Installation
* First install quasar and vuejs (google them ya' lazy so-and-so!) so that you have their `cli`s installed globally.
